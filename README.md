# Understanding bacterial adaptation to osmotic stress through the lenses of thermodynamics
In this repository, you will every code and ressources used to reproduced the data presented in our paper.\
To proceed, copy the repository and install the conda environment.yml file.\
To reproduce the figure, simply select the python file in MDF_Osmolarity repository with the name of the figure you want to recreate. These will perform the analysis used to generate the simulated data.\
The output will be found in the Result folder.
\
\
Folders:\
**Experimental** Data generated in the wet lab\
**Results** Results of each of the analysis\
**To_make_model** These codes should allow you to recreate your own thermodynamic models which are going to be the input of all further analysis\
**Uncertainty** The results of our Delta G uncertainty analysis\
**resources** This file contains everything that was required as an input for our analysis\
